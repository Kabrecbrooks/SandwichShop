# DELI-cious Sandwich Shop - Java Console App

Welcome to **DELI-cious**, a Java-based point-of-sale (POS) system for a sandwich shop. This console application allows users to create customized sandwich orders including drinks, chips, toppings, sauces, and sides. Receipts are saved to local files for order tracking.

## üßæ Description of Key Files

### `Main.java`

-   Entry point of the application.
    
-   Initializes the scanner and presents a basic home menu for the user:
    
    -   Start new order
        
    -   Exit program
        

### `HomeScreen.java`

-   Alternative home screen interface.
    
-   Currently similar in function to `Main.java`'s menu but more modular.
    
-   Calls `Order` class to start a new order session.
    

### `Order.java`

-   Handles the full order lifecycle:
    
    -   Adding sandwiches, drinks, chips
        
    -   Reviewing and confirming orders
        
    -   Generating and saving receipt files
        
-   Uses `Scanner` to receive user input and interacts with item classes (`Sandwich`, `Drinks`, `Chips`).
    

### `Sandwich.java`

-   Core class for sandwich creation.
    
-   Allows users to:
    
    -   Select bread and size
        
    -   Choose meat, cheese, and regular toppings
        
    -   Add sauces and sides
